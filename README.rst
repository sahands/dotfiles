"dotfiles" repository
======================
Use at your own risk! Some of the scripts might (probably *will*!) overwrite
certain files and configurations.

Setting up config dot files
---------------------------
Run `./scripts/create_sym_links.sh`.


Mac OS 10 Setup
---------------
Make sure you have XCode, XCode Command Line Tools, and MacPorts installed.
Then run `./scripts/mac_bootstrap.sh`.
